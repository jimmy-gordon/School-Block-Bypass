# School-Block-Bypass

Hey there! Have you ever wanted to do more with your School Chromebook but it has almost every site blocked and/or restricted? Well, this is the guide for you! This comprehensive guide will provide you with several methods, ranging from easy to hard, to suite your block-bypassing needs. Due to the nature and variety of manages devices, some methods may be completely unavailable for some.

> ◇ **This should come without saying, but please use these methods at your OWN RISK. Some are safer than others, but be aware you could put not only your device, but also your account, at risk.** ◇

# Methods
> 1️⃣ College Board (Does not require login)
- This method requires that you have the College Board Secure Testing Browser in your "Apps" panel on the device login screen. Is generally the safest method, but can be limited (*).
> 2️⃣ Proxy Method (Requires login)
- This method only requires that you are logged into your account with an active browser available (Chrome). It can be unreliable depending on if your District Administration has blocked the site list.

# Before Getting Started
Before explaining the individual methods, here are some general tips and notes to keep in mind.

1. No method is guaranteed to work, and performance may vary by device.
2. A good rule of thumb when performing a bypass is to avoid using Google to login to your preferred sites. That is, use an email/password login method; avoid "Continuing With Google". This may lead to undesirable results.
3. Remember that your device may become more vulnerable, especially when using a proxy. Bypassing can lead to avoiding safety restrictions placed by your administrator.
 
# 1️⃣ College Board

- College Board provides a number of chromebooks with a secure Testing Browser app that is normally used to conduct exams, and to prevent cheating. We will be taking advantage of its more isolated browsing experience to access a variant of Google Search. Although it is more limited in nature than the second method, it can still help to circumvent local programs such as GoGuardian.
> * This method may still fall under Cisco Umbrella and similar blocking applications, even within the secure testing app. A workaround for this can be using cellular data on your Chromebook, although it is unlikely you have been provided a proper plan.

With all of that out of the way, here is exactly how to perform this bypass.

1. On your organization login screen, navigate to the "Apps" button on the bottom left of the screen, on the Taskbar.
3. Once clicked, look for an app named "College Board". It's icon should resemble a padlock. Open the app.
> If you cannot find such an app, then you are unable to perform this method. Try out the "Proxy" section for an alternate method.
5. On the welcome screen that appears, click "Student". If you get a popup stating that your exam will be marked invalid, simply click, "Acknowledge and Return".
6. On the sign in screen that appears, select "Student Help" or "Professional Help". It doesn't really matter which.
7. Navigate to the bottom panel of the screen. You will see a set of resource and help links. On the right-most column, click on, "Contact Us".
8. Once provided with a list of contacts, find one with a direct email link. One located near the top is ```sateducator@collegeboard.org```. Click on it.
9. On the Google sign in popup, **DO NOT SIGN IN**! Rather, click on, "Learn more about using Guest Mode".
10. Locate the waffle menu at the top right of the screen, next to the Sign In button. Click it, and then select the Google App.
11. Done! You have access to an unblocked browser!
> Again, make sure to not sign in throughout the process. This method also limits you to only one tab, so choose wgat you would like to do wisely.

- To exit out of the app, hold down your power button and select Sign Out. This method is great for those who don't need any extra resources, and just want to have access to an open and fast browser. Although, it has the drawback of being slightly difficult to access, and may pose interruptions with exam popups.

# 2️⃣ Proxy

- A web proxy is almost like a browser inside of a browser. With this guide, we will be using **CroxyProxy**. There are several other options, but this one allows for the fastest response times and easiest-to-use interface, with the least-blocked domain. This method can be used across tabs, and allows you to fully utilize your chromebook as usual, with the bonus of being unlimited by site blacklists.

> NOTE: Teachers using GoGuardian or similar monitoring programs will still be able to view your screen when having the proxy site open. So, use this method at your own risk!

- Accessing CroxyProxy
1. Open your browsee.
2. In the search bar, type in one of its many domains. A list has been provided for you below:
```
167.71.43.43
CorxyProxy.com
Cdn.CroxyProxy.com
CroxyProxy.rocks
```
- Generally, the direct IP (the first in the list) seems to have the most success. Others may lead to an unresponsive page or are easily picked up by Cisco Umbrella filters.

- Once you have opened CroxyProxy, you essentially have access to a completely unblocked browser. I'd recommend using one of the provided fast-access links to open either a DuckDuckGo or Google browser for a more streamlined searching experience.
- You may also come across several ads; make sure to X out of them.
- If you find the proxy to be unresponsive or slow, consider opening it again in a new window, or refreshing the page.
- Due to the nature of proxies, links can quickly become invalid. So, be aware that bookmarking proxies sites may return an invalid address after a few hours.
- Similarly to Method 1️⃣, avoid logging into sites with Google.
