# School-Block-Bypass

Hey there! Have you ever wanted to do more with your School Chromebook but it has almost every site blocked and/or restricted? Well, this is the guide for you! This comprehensive guide will provide you with several methods, ranging from easy to hard, to suite your block-bypassing needs.

> This should come without saying, but please use these methods at your own risk. Some are safer than others, but be aware you could put not only your device, but also your account, at risk.

# Methods
> 1️⃣ College Board (Does not require login)
- This method requires that you have the College Board Secure Testing Browser in your "Apps" panel on the device login screen. Is generally the safest method, but can be limited (*).
> 2️⃣ Proxy Method (Requires login)
- This method only requires that you are logged into your account with an active browser available (Chrome). It can be unreliable depending on if your District Administration has blocked the site list.

# Before Getting Started
Before explaining the individual methods, here are some general tips and notes to keep in mind.

1. No method is guaranteed to work, and performance may vary by device.
2. A good rule of thumb when performing a bypass is to avoid using Google to login to your preferred sites. That is, use an email/password login method; avoid "Continuing With Google". This may lead to undesirable results.
3. Remember that your device may become more vulnerable, especially when using a proxy. Bypassing can lead to avoiding safety restrictions placed by your administrator.
